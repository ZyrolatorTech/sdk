## 🧠 What Is ZYROLATOR?

ZYROLATOR is a personality-engine framework designed to:

- Create resilient adult-grade personalities
- Enable agents to evolve through accumulated experience
- Compound intelligence across isolated systems
- Move beyond reactive chat models into autonomous identity structures

Instead of generating replies, ZYROLATOR builds personalities.

## 🚀 Core Philosophy

Traditional systems:
- Stateless
- Prompt-bound
- Session-limited
- Behaviorally shallow

ZYROLATOR:
- Experience-compounding
- Identity-driven
- Resilient under isolation
- Structured for long-term evolution

Agents built with ZYROLATOR are designed to grow.

## 🧩 Architecture Principles

- **Personality First** – Identity precedes output.
- **Resilience by Design** – Isolation does not degrade growth.
- **Compound Learning** – Experience stacks, not resets.
- **Adult Cognition Modeling** – Stable reasoning, emotional consistency, long-horizon thinking.
